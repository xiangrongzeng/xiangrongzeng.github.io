本文介绍nltk的基本用法

# 安装
## python包安装

## 数据安装
If you met the problem when downloading NLTK Data, such as download time out or other strange things, I suggest you download the NLTK data directly by nltk_data github page:

https://github.com/nltk/nltk_data

It said that “NLTK Data lives in the gh-pages branch of this repository.”, so you can visit the branch:

https://github.com/nltk/nltk_data/tree/master

Download the zip file and unzip it, then copy the six sub-directory in the packages into your nltk_data directory: chunkers, corpora, help, stemmers, taggers, tokenizers

Maybe this is the best unofficial way to install NLTK_Data.
